# gazd_okosanMD
work in progress MD project gazd√°lkodj okosan. VERY early stage
This is a project of mine for the MD console, which is a nice board game. To my knowledge there isn't anything even similar on a console. The art assets are owned by their respective owners, this is just a programming practice. The code is messy, i don't think it can be used for anything else than this. Use the latest SecondBasic compiler to compile the code.
Let me know if you want to use some of this stuff for your project, i'm happy to help.
